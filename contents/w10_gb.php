<h1>Adding guestbook to your site.</h1>
<p>So, imagine you have a simple site with html, head and body tags.</p>
<p>What we are doing is simply putting <a href="w10_gb_code.txt">this</a> code somewhere in the body</p>
<p>Example: the Gamma World simply putted guestbook to the main tag which itself is inside of body.</p>
