      <title>Gamma63's site --> Gamma World</title>
      <description>Gamma63's personal website is now Gamma World Portal! On Gamma World you can read journals, read rss feeds, download retro software, and much more! Gamma World is going to expand almost every day; Also you can probably ask why I am moving from personal website concept to portal-like site, that's because I am experiencing burnout in osdev, so in order to recover faster, I've decided to convert the site into a portal.</description>
